-- This should work if there are more than one product selling most 
-- for example a pen and refills for the pen would be the two best selling products. 
-- It should be possible to get the sales value by using the prices table 
-- but I canâ€™t get it to work but an additional 
-- SELECT * FROM PRICES WHERE PID=XXXXX and multiply by 
-- the count would give the same result.
